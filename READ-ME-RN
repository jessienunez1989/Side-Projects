Hi 👋, I'm Rafael Nunez

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Wilson Tech Program (Electronics ---> Computer Networking)
  Since im only in the first half of the first year of this program I have not done anything software related besides copying the coding to an arduino. This being the case I already know that I will slow down the learning process but I will try my best.

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Projects
  Any projects my brother has in mind as well as projects reguarding hardware or software in school is something im looking forward to. 

- 🤝 I’m looking for help with Software programs
  Learning to code/program would be a great boost to my carear and is something I do have interest in already. 

- 💬 Ask me about anything you feel I could help in.
  If you have a problem with anything that I may be of use to, do not hesitate to contact me.
