Hi 👋, I'm Rafael Nunez

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Wilson Tech Program (Electronics ---> Computer Networking)
  Since im only in the first half of the first year of this program I have not done anything software related besides copying the coding to an arduino. This being the case I already know that I will slow down the learning process but I will try my best.

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Projects
  Any projects my brother has in mind as well as projects reguarding hardware or software in school is something im looking forward to.

  Learning to code/program would be a great boost to my carear and is something I do have interest in already.
